## 1. Vision

Aangan is a residential society's shared courtyard — one app for everything neighbours need
from each other: home food, services, buy & sell, community posts, and a trusted directory.

**Design tenets:**
- Every new service is **config, not code** (registry-driven).
- No in-app payments — WhatsApp + UPI, as trusted neighbours do.
- **Multi-society from the start** — each society is isolated; shared infrastructure.
- **Fast and responsive** at any scale: offline-first, paginated, realtime where it matters.
- Works great as a **web PWA today**; ships to iOS + Android when web is stable.

## 2. Service Categories

### 2a. Current categories (10) — ✅ All in services.ts

| # | Key | Label | Type | Status |
|---|-----|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | `food` | Home Food | Food engine | ✅ |
| 1 | `tuition` | Tuitions | Service | ✅ |
| 2 | `tailoring` | Tailoring | Service | ✅ |
| 3 | `tax` | Income Tax | Service | ✅ |
| 4 | `clinic` | Clinic | Service | ✅ |
| 5 | `catering` | Catering | Service | ✅ |
| 6 | `decoration` | Decoration | Service | ✅ |
| 7 | `jobs` | Job Referral | Post | ✅ |
| 8 | `market` | Buy & Sell | Product | ✅ |
| 9 | `directory` | Service Directory | Recommendation | ✅ |

### 2b. Added categories — ✅ All in services.ts

| # | Key | Label | Status |
|---|-----|-------|--------|
| 10 | `daycare` | Day Care | ✅ Phase 3 |
| 11 | `fitness` | Yoga & Fitness | ✅ Phase 3 |
| 12 | `arts` | Arts & Activities | ✅ Phase 3 |
| 13 | `astrology` | Astrology | ✅ Phase 3 |
| 14 | `carpooling` | Carpooling | ✅ Phase 11 |

**On dance & painting:** Recommend **one combined "Arts & Activities" category** rather than
two separate categories or folding into Tuitions. Reasons:

1. **Tuitions** = academic subjects (Math, Science, Languages, competitive exams). Parents
   search with board/grade context. Attributes: subject, grade, mode.
2. **Dance & Painting** = creative/extracurricular. Different search intent, different
   attributes (style, age group, batch size, schedule). Mixing them with academic tuitions
   creates noise in both directions.
3. **Two separate** categories (dance / painting) would be too thin for most societies —
   you'd never have enough listings to justify dedicated feeds. One "Arts & Activities"
   category with a `type` attribute (Dance, Painting, Music, Craft, Drama, Other) is richer
   and more useful.
4. Yoga similarly sits better in a **Yoga & Fitness** category (wellness/exercise context)
   than alongside academic tuitions.

**Attributes for new categories:**

```
daycare:
  age_range     select  [Infant (0–1), Toddler (1–3), Preschool (3–6), After school (6–12)]
  timings       text    "Mon–Sat, 7 AM – 7 PM"
  capacity      number  (max children)
  meals_included toggle
  pickup_drop    toggle

fitness:
  type          select  [Yoga, Zumba, Gym training, Meditation, Pilates, Other]
  level         select  [Beginner, All levels, Intermediate, Advanced]
  format        select  [Group class, 1-on-1, Online, Hybrid]
  timings       text    "6–7 AM, 6–7 PM"
  gender        select  [All genders, Women only, Men only]

arts:
  type          multiselect [Dance, Painting, Music, Craft, Drama, Drawing, Other]
  age_group     multiselect [Kids (5–12), Teens (13–18), Adults, All ages]
  format        select  [Group class, 1-on-1, Online, At my place]
  timings       text
  style         text    "Bharatnatyam, Watercolour, Hindustani…"
```

## 3. Architecture

### 3a. Three engines (unchanged)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    HOME HUB                          │
│         service tile grid (15 categories)            │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
         ┌─────────┴──────────┐
         ▼                    ▼
 ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────────┐
 │ FOOD ENGINE  │   │ LISTINGS ENGINE  │
 │ dishes/orders│   │ 12 categories    │
 │ tiffin/subs  │   │ listings+inquiry │
 └──────────────┘   └──────────────────┘
         │                    │
         └────── Supabase ────┘
   auth.uid() · RLS · RPCs · realtime · push
```

### 3b. Multi-society architecture

```
communities (one row per society)
    │
    ├── profiles.community_id  (which society each user belongs to)
    ├── listings.community_id  (which society each listing belongs to)
    ├── dishes.community_id    (which society each dish belongs to — existing via chef)
    └── posts.community_id     (community threads — new)

RLS ensures every query is implicitly scoped to auth user's community_id.
```

**Key principle:** A user belongs to exactly one society. All feeds, posts, and listings are
scoped to that society. Admins of a society can manage that society only. Platform admins
(super-admins) can see all.

## 6. Roles & Permissions

### Current roles ✅
- **foodie** — default; can browse, order, post any listing
- **chef** — food provider; Kitchen dashboard; post dishes/tiffin
- **admin** — society admin; moderate listings, manage members

### Extended model ⬜
- **super_admin** — platform-level; can see all societies, approve join requests, manage communities. Set directly in DB — not self-service.
- Society-scoped admin is enforced via `profile.community_id` matching `listing.community_id`. An admin can only moderate their own society's content.
- All RLS policies scope to `auth.uid()`'s `community_id` — users are **hard-isolated** by society. No cross-society data leakage possible.

### Access control matrix ⬜

| Action | Foodie | Chef | Admin | Super-admin |
|--------|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| View own society feed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View other society | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Post listing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Post dish/tiffin | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete own listing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete any listing | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pin a post | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mark feedback resolved | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Approve society | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage members | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

#### 5b. Issues / feedback / suggestions ✅
- ✅ Covered by Feed tab with `issue/feedback/suggestion` category filters
- ✅ Resolved status badge in feed + thread view
- ✅ Admin can mark issues as resolved from PostMenu

---

### ✅ Phase 6 — Search & Filter
*Complete (core).*

- ✅ `(tabs)/search.tsx` — unified search bar with debounce (350ms)
  - Listings search: `ilike` on `title + description` via `searchListings()`
  - Category filter chips (horizontal scroll, all 14 service categories)
  - Empty states: initial, searching, no results
  - Results in 2/3-col responsive grid using ListingCard
- ✅ `searchListings()` in `listings.ts` — communityId-scoped, category-filterable
- ✅ Posts search — `searchPosts()` (FTS-first + ilike fallback); Search screen now has a **Listings / Posts** toggle
- ✅ Supabase full-text indexes — `search_tsv` GIN on listings + posts (migration `0022`); `searchListings` upgraded to FTS-first
- ✅ Recent searches in AsyncStorage (`lib/recentSearches.ts`) — chips in the Search empty state

---

### ✅ Phase 7 — Access Control Hardening & Admin Tools
*Core complete. Some items remain for future.*

- ✅ All tables have RLS with `community_id` scoping (posts, post_comments, listings, inquiries)
- ✅ `is_admin(uid)` DB function (migration 0017) — checks `roles @> array['admin']`
- ✅ Updated `posts` and `post_comments` RLS to use `is_admin()` for delete policies
- ✅ Admin dashboard — Members tab: role management with toggle chips
- ✅ Admin dashboard — Requests tab: view/approve/reject society join requests
- ⬜ Super-admin role (future — set directly in DB for now)
- ⬜ Reported listings queue (migration 0017 schema designed; UI pending)
- ⬜ Category toggles per society (future)
- ⬜ Rate limiting (future)

---

### ✅ Phase 8 — About Page & App Ops
*Complete (core).*

- ✅ `about.tsx` — app info screen with version, features, technical info, legal links
- ✅ NavRail: About link (desktop)
- ✅ `app_versions` table (migration 0016) for update notifications
- ✅ `delete_own_account` RPC (migration 0015)
- ⬜ Update notification banner on Home load (reads `app_versions` table — planned)

---

### 🔄 Phase 9 — Performance & Scalability
*In progress. Core wins done.*

#### 9a. Rendering performance
- ✅ `React.memo` on `ListingCard` and `DishCard`
- ✅ `PostCard` extracted to a memoized component (feed.tsx:224)
- ✅ Posts feed uses `FlashList` (`@shopify/flash-list` installed; feed.tsx)
- ✅ Skeleton loaders for posts feed (`PostCardSkeleton`)
- ✅ Category feed + search results now use `FlashList` (numColumns, centered maxWidth; `estimatedItemSize` removed for FlashList v2)
- ✅ Skeleton loading states for **search** results (`ListingCardSkeleton` grid)

#### 9b. Data & caching
- ✅ Paginate category feeds: `limit(20)` + "Load more" in `c/[category].tsx`
- ✅ Stale-while-revalidate (AsyncStorage cache already in category feed)
- ✅ Search debounce (350ms) in search.tsx
- ✅ Paginate posts feed (PAGE=20 + "Load more"; feed.tsx)
- ⬜ Supabase full-text search indexes (future migration — note: 0018 is already `saved_listings`)
- ⬜ Debounce realtime refetch (50ms)

#### 9c. Image performance
- ✅ `expo-image` with `cachePolicy="memory-disk"` on ListingCard, listing hero, DishCard (shared `IMAGE_CACHE_PROPS` in `lib/image.ts`)
- ✅ Blurhash placeholders + 200ms fade while images load (one neutral hash; no per-image hashing)
- ✅ Upload pipeline: resize to 1000px width + JPEG 0.7 — done for **both** listings (`uploadListingPhoto`) and food (`uploadDishPhoto`)
- ⬜ Supabase Storage image transforms (`?width=400&quality=75` URL param) for thumbnails vs full

#### 9d. Web / PWA
- ✅ Service worker: offline shell + asset caching (`public/sw.js` — network-first nav, SWR assets, shell precached on install; cache `aangan-v2`)
- ⬜ Route code-splitting (Expo Router does this by default — verify bundles)
- ✅ `preconnect` + `dns-prefetch` to Supabase URL in `+html.tsx`
- ⬜ Lighthouse audit: target ≥ 90 performance, ≥ 90 PWA, ≥ 90 accessibility

#### 9e. Native performance (post-EAS)
- ⬜ Hermes engine (default in Expo SDK 56) — verify enabled in EAS builds
- ⬜ New Architecture (Fabric + JSI) — verify with SDK 56 defaults
- ⬜ Startup time budget: < 2s cold start on mid-range Android
- ⬜ Bundle size budget: track and gate on CI

#### 9f. Monitoring
- ⬜ Sentry: error tracking (crashes, unhandled rejections)
- ⬜ PostHog: analytics (screen views, key actions, retention)

## 9. Decisions Log

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | App name | ✅ **Aangan** |
| 2 | Auth | ✅ Supabase Auth, phone-as-email alias, 6-digit code as password |
| 3 | Email alias domain | ✅ Keep `@senate.app` forever — invisible to users, breaking change to migrate |
| 4 | Payments | ✅ No in-app payments; WhatsApp + UPI only |
| 5 | Posting model | ✅ Open posting (any member) + admin moderation; verified badge in Phase 11 |
| 6 | Inquiry model | ✅ In-app inquiry record + WhatsApp deep-link |
| 7 | Phase 2 rollout | ✅ All listing categories launched together |
| 8 | Multi-society | ✅ Architect for multi-society from start; dynamic community_id |
| 9 | Dance/Painting vs Tuitions | ✅ Separate "Arts & Activities" category — different search intent and attributes |
| 10 | Yoga category | ✅ "Yoga & Fitness" — wellness context, not academic |
| 11 | iOS/Android timing | ✅ After web version is feature-complete and stable |
| 12 | Community posts engine | ✅ Separate `posts` + `post_comments` tables; not shoehorned into listings |
| 13 | Feedback/issues | ✅ Posts table with `category` column (issue/feedback/suggestion) — not a separate table |
| 14 | Feedback tab vs separate page | ✅ Merge into Feed tab with category filter chips — keeps tab count at 5 |
| 15 | Approve join request | ✅ Admin sets `status=approved`; creating the society row is a manual admin step for now |
| 16 | `delete_own_account` | ✅ Supabase SECURITY DEFINER RPC — cleanest approach for deleting auth.users |
| 17 | Polls voting model | ✅ Upsert with `onConflict: poll_id,user_id` — users can change their vote; one vote per poll |
| 18 | Carpooling | ✅ Added as listing service category (not a separate posts engine) — same CRUD pattern |
| 19 | Saved listings | ✅ Composite PK `(user_id, listing_id)`; 23505 conflict silently swallowed on duplicate save |
| 20 | In-app chat model | ✅ Phase 12a per-listing threads built (society-readable, like post_comments); full 1:1 DMs deferred to 12b |
| 21 | Push notifications | ✅ DB architecture (pg_net triggers) + client token capture both complete; end-to-end delivery verifiable only on a native build (Phase 10) |
| 22 | SMS / OTP | ✅ Auth uses PIN (not SMS OTP); no SMS gateway needed — intentional, keeps infra simple |

---

## 10. Notifications — Current State

### WhatsApp (deep-link, NOT API)
WhatsApp is used as a **deep-link redirect** (opens `https://wa.me/<number>?text=...`), NOT an API integration.

| Trigger | Status | How it works |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Buyer orders food | ✅ | `buildWhatsAppOrderLink()` — opens WhatsApp with pre-filled order message to chef's number |
| Buyer enquires about listing | ✅ | `buildInquiryWhatsAppLink()` — opens WhatsApp to listing owner's number |
| Any other action | ❌ | No WhatsApp API integration exists |

**Intentional design:** No paid WhatsApp Business API needed. Works via `wa.me` URL which every Indian smartphone user understands.

**Gap:** Users must have WhatsApp installed, and must have shared their WhatsApp number on their profile. If a number is missing, the button silently does nothing useful.

### SMS / OTP
Auth uses phone number as a **fake email alias** (`phone@senate.app`) with a **6-digit PIN as password**. There is **no real SMS OTP** — the user sets a PIN at signup and uses it to sign in. No SMS gateway (Twilio, MSG91, etc.) is integrated.

### Expo Push Notifications (native iOS/Android only)
The architecture exists but registration is **incomplete**:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `push_tokens` table (migration 0005) | ✅ Exists |
| `notify_user()` Postgres function via `pg_net` | ✅ Exists |
| Order status change → buyer notified | ✅ DB trigger fires |
| New inquiry → listing owner notified | ✅ DB trigger fires |
| **Token capture code in app** | ✅ **Done** — `registerPush()` (lib/push.ts) calls `getExpoPushTokenAsync()` and upserts to `push_tokens`; invoked from auth.tsx on login |
| New post/comment notification | ❌ Not implemented |
| New poll notification | ❌ Not implemented |
| Web push | ❌ Not supported (Expo tokens are native-only) |

**Status:** Token capture is wired (`lib/push.ts` → `getExpoPushTokenAsync()` with EAS project ID → upsert into `push_tokens`, called from `auth.tsx` on login). It is a **native-only no-op on web** (`Platform.OS === 'web' || !Device.isDevice` early-return), so end-to-end delivery can only be verified once a native build exists (Phase 10). The DB triggers (order status, new inquiry) will then have a token to deliver to. On web, push simply doesn't apply.

## 11. In-App Chat — Analysis & Plan

### What exists today
| Feature | Chat capability |
|---------|----------------|
| Feed posts | ✅ Realtime comment threads (post_comments) |
| Listing contact | ⚡ WhatsApp deep-link only — no in-app history |
| Food orders | ⚡ WhatsApp deep-link only |
| Direct messages | ❌ None |
| Carpool coordination | ⚡ WhatsApp only |

### Where in-app chat adds real value

**1. Per-listing inquiry threads (high value, low complexity)**
Right now, when a user enquires about a tutor or service, it opens WhatsApp. This loses the conversation from the app and requires the person to share their personal phone. A **per-listing thread** (same pattern as post_comments but scoped to a listing) lets:
- Buyer ask: "Are you available on Saturdays?"
- Owner reply in-app
- Both sides see the history in the app
- Admin can moderate if needed

**2. Carpool coordination threads (high value)**
Carpool listings inherently need multi-turn conversation (pickup point changes, last-minute cancellations). A thread per carpool listing is the right model.

**3. Direct messages / neighbour DMs (medium value, high complexity)**
Useful for private conversation that isn't tied to a listing (e.g., "Hey, can I borrow your parking slot this weekend?"). Full N-to-N DM system requires a `conversations` + `messages` schema, read receipts, notification infrastructure. Defer until after per-listing threads are stable.

### Recommendation — Phase 12: In-App Chat

**Phase 12a (per-listing threads — ✅ BUILT):**
- ✅ New table: `listing_messages (id, listing_id, author_id, body, created_at)` — migration `0021_listing_messages.sql`
- ✅ RLS: society members can read; members post as themselves (author_id = auth.uid()); author or admin deletes
- ✅ Realtime subscription on `listing_id` (`subscribeToListingMessages`)
- ✅ Push on new message: neighbour→owner, and owner-reply→all other thread participants (reuses `notify_user` + pg_net)
- ✅ UI: collapsible "Chat with owner" section (`components/listings/ListingChat.tsx`) on listing detail, lazy-loads + subscribes on first open
- ✅ Service layer: `src/lib/listingMessages.ts` (fetch/send/delete/subscribe)
- ✅ Migration `0021_listing_messages.sql` run in Supabase — **feature is LIVE**

**Phase 12b (direct messages — ✅ BUILT):**
- ✅ Tables (migration `0023_direct_messages.sql`): `dm_threads (id, community_id, user_a, user_b, last_message, last_message_at)` with canonical `user_a < user_b` + unique pair; `dm_messages (id, thread_id, sender_id, body, read_at, created_at)`
- ✅ RLS: only the two participants read/write; `dm_messages.update` lets a participant set `read_at`
- ✅ `dm_get_or_create_thread(p_other)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC — atomic, same-community enforced
- ✅ Trigger on new message: bumps thread `last_message`/`last_message_at` + push-notifies the recipient (reuses `notify_user`)
- ✅ Realtime on `dm_messages` + `dm_threads`
- ✅ Service layer: `src/lib/dm.ts` (getOrCreateThread, fetchInbox, fetchThread, fetchMessages, sendMessage, markThreadRead, fetchUnreadThreadCount, subscribe)
- ✅ UI: inbox `src/app/messages/index.tsx`, thread `src/app/messages/[threadId].tsx` (realtime, read receipts, profile link in header)
- ✅ Entry points: "Message" button on `profile/[userId]`, "Messages" in NavRail (desktop) + Home Community tile (mobile); routes registered in `_layout`
- ⏸️ **User action:** run `0023_direct_messages.sql` in Supabase to activate

## 12. End-to-End Testing Guide

### Step 1 — Run all Supabase migrations

Open **Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor** and run these in order. Each file is in `/supabase/migrations/`:

```
0001_init.sql                ← communities, profiles, dishes, orders
0002_orders.sql              ← order RPCs
0003_auth_profiles.sql       ← auth + roles
0004_order_lifecycle.sql     ← full order lifecycle
0005_push.sql                ← push_tokens, notify_user() trigger
0006_serve_date.sql          ← serve_date on dishes
0007_tiffin.sql              ← tiffin_plans, subscriptions
0008_communities_meta.sql    ← communities.slug + address
0009_profile_community.sql   ← profiles.community_id FK
0010_listings.sql            ← listings table + RLS + realtime
0011_inquiries.sql           ← inquiries table + push trigger
0012_posts.sql               ← posts table + RLS + realtime
0013_post_comments.sql       ← post_comments + realtime
0014_society_requests.sql    ← society_join_requests
0015_delete_account_rpc.sql  ← delete_own_account() RPC
0016_app_versions.sql        ← app_versions table + seed row
0017_is_admin_fn.sql         ← is_admin() function + RLS updates
0018_saved_listings.sql      ← saved_listings table
0019_emergency_contacts.sql  ← emergency_contacts table
0020_polls.sql               ← polls + poll_options + poll_votes
0021_listing_messages.sql    ← per-listing chat threads + push  ✅ run
0022_fulltext_search.sql     ← search_tsv + GIN indexes         ✅ run
0023_direct_messages.sql     ← DMs: threads, messages, RPC      ✅ run
0024_listings_read_scope.sql ← community-scope listings_read    ✅ run
0025_member_moderation.sql   ← profiles.blocked + admin RPCs    (NEW — run this)
0026_notifications.sql       ← notifications + reads + triggers (NEW — run this)
```

### Step 2 — Create Supabase Storage bucket

In **Supabase Dashboard → Storage → New bucket**:
- Name: `listing-photos`
- Public: **Yes** (check the toggle)
- Click Create

### Step 3 — Create a test society (community)

In **Supabase → SQL Editor**:
```sql
insert into public.communities (name, slug, address)
values ('Green Valley Apartments', 'green-valley', 'Sector 12, Noida, UP')
returning id;
```
Copy the returned UUID — you'll use it in Step 5.

### Step 4 — Sign up your first user (yourself)

1. Open the web app (`npx expo start --web` or deployed URL)
2. Enter your phone number and create a 6-digit PIN
3. Fill in name, flat number, WhatsApp
4. In the society picker, select the society you just created
5. Complete sign-up

### Step 5 — Grant admin role to your account

In **Supabase → SQL Editor** (replace `<phone>` with your number):
```sql
update public.profiles
set roles = array['foodie', 'chef', 'admin']
where phone = '<your-phone-number>';
```

Or by user ID (find it in the auth.users table or profiles table):
```sql
update public.profiles
set roles = array['foodie', 'chef', 'admin']
where id = '<your-uuid>';
```

### Step 6 — Verify admin access in the app

Reload the app. You should now see:
- ✅ "Admin · manage members & roles" row in the You tab
- ✅ "Admin" link in the desktop NavRail
- ✅ Admin shield icon in the You tab header area
- ✅ "+" button on Emergency Contacts screen
- ✅ "Announcement" category available in Feed compose
- ✅ Can close/delete polls

### Step 7 — Feature test checklist

**Home Hub:**
- [ ] 15 service tiles visible (food + 14 categories)
- [ ] "Community" section shows Polls + Emergency tiles
- [ ] Tapping tiles navigates to correct screen
- [ ] Society badge shows your society name
- [ ] Greeting changes based on time of day

**Food engine:**
- [ ] Post a dish (as chef): name, slot, veg type, price, photo (optional)
- [ ] Order a dish (as another account or same in food tab): qty, confirm
- [ ] Order lifecycle: accept → cooking → delivered (Kitchen section)
- [ ] Tiffin: create a recurring tiffin service

**Listings:**
- [ ] Post a listing in any of the 14 categories
- [ ] Photo upload (tap camera area in CreateListingForm)
- [ ] View listing detail — bookmark button (top-right of hero)
- [ ] Tap "Contact on WhatsApp" — should open WhatsApp with pre-filled message
- [ ] Saved listings appear in You → Saved tab
- [ ] Search: type keywords in Search tab, filter by category chip

**Community Feed:**
- [ ] Post a General/Issue/Feedback/Event/Lost & Found message
- [ ] Admin: post an Announcement (non-admin shouldn't see this option)
- [ ] Comment on a post (from the post thread screen)
- [ ] Admin: pin a post, mark issue as resolved
- [ ] Realtime: open Feed in two tabs/devices, post from one → appears in the other

**Polls:**
- [ ] Home → Polls tile → polls screen
- [ ] Create a poll (any member) with 2+ options
- [ ] Vote on a poll — results bar appears
- [ ] Admin: close a poll, delete a poll

**Emergency Contacts:**
- [ ] Home → Emergency tile → emergency screen
- [ ] Admin: tap "+" → add a contact with name, phone, role type
- [ ] Tap dial button → should trigger a phone call (`tel:` link)
- [ ] Admin: delete a contact

**Profile:**
- [ ] You tab → tap avatar → profile/me.tsx
- [ ] Edit name, flat, WhatsApp, UPI → Save Changes
- [ ] Tap any listing owner's name → public profile page (profile/[userId])

**Admin panel (admin only):**
- [ ] You tab → Admin row → admin.tsx
- [ ] Members tab: see all members, toggle chef/admin roles
- [ ] Requests tab: see join requests (submit one from a second account to test)

## 13. Immediate Next Steps (updated)

**Backend setup — ✅ Done (2026-06-08):**
1. ✅ All migrations 0001–0020 run in Supabase
2. ✅ `listing-photos` public storage bucket created
3. ✅ Test community seeded + admin granted
4. ✅ Web deployed to GitHub + Vercel (main)

**Code — recently shipped (2026-06-08):**
5. ✅ **Phase 12a: Per-listing chat threads** — migration `0021_listing_messages.sql` (run), `lib/listingMessages.ts`, collapsible `ListingChat` on listing detail (realtime + push). **LIVE.**
6. ✅ Push token capture — `getExpoPushTokenAsync()` wired in lib/push.ts; end-to-end delivery to verify on native build (Phase 10)
7. ✅ Skeleton loaders for search results (`ListingCardSkeleton` grid)
8. ✅ Inquiry-count badge — "N interested" on MyListingsSection cards
9. ✅ Perf: category + search grids → FlashList; expo-image memory-disk cache + blurhash placeholders
10. ✅ **Phase 12b: Direct messages** — migration `0023`, `lib/dm.ts`, inbox + thread screens, Message button + NavRail/Home entry points.
11. ✅ **Full-text search** — migration `0022`, FTS `searchListings`/`searchPosts`, Search Listings/Posts toggle.
12. ✅ **PWA** — Supabase preconnect + service-worker shell precache. (Service worker already existed; food resize already shipped.)

**✅ Migrations 0022 + 0023 run and runtime-verified** (2026-06-08) against prod Supabase:
DM thread dedupe, realtime delivery, participant-only RLS (non-participant blocked), inbox
last-message bump, mark-read; FTS stem-matching on listings ("dancing"→"dance") and posts.

**⏸️ User action — run `0024_listings_read_scope.sql`** to apply the listings cross-society RLS fix.

**Code — polish shipped (2026-06-08):**
- ✅ **Unread-DM badge** — shared `UnreadDmsProvider` (one realtime sub) → badge on NavRail "Messages" + Home Messages tile (`9+` cap)
- ✅ **Recent searches** — `lib/recentSearches.ts` (AsyncStorage, deduped, max 8); tappable chips in the Search empty state with Clear; saved on submit + result tap
- ✅ **Security:** `listings_read` cross-society leak fixed — community-scoped in migration `0024` (run)
- ⏭️ **Skipped — Supabase Storage image transforms:** the render/transform endpoint is a paid (Pro) feature; on the free tier it 400s and would break thumbnails. 1000px upload + memory-disk cache already cover the win.

**Code — remaining candidates:**
- ⬜ Lighthouse ≥90 audit pass (PWA/perf/a11y) — needs a deployed build + the Lighthouse tool to measure
- ⬜ Per-thread unread indicators inside the DM inbox (nav badge done)
- ⬜ Tighten other `auth.role()='authenticated'`-only reads if any remain (audit dishes/tiffin)

**When ready for native (Phase 10):**
8. **⏸️ Apple Developer account** ($99/yr) → TestFlight → App Store
9. **⏸️ Google Play account** ($25) → internal track → Play Store
10. **⏸️ Verify push delivery end-to-end** — token registration is already wired (lib/push.ts); confirm tokens upsert + triggers deliver on a real native build
11. **⏸️ App icons** — 1024×1024 iOS icon + Android adaptive icon foreground layer

## 11. Change Log

| Date | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| 2026-06-09 | **Multi-community scoping + 2 bug fixes.** (1) `fetchDishes`/`listTiffinPlans`/`postDish`/`createTiffinPlan` now take the user's `communityId` instead of the hardcoded `COMMUNITY_ID` (callers in food/kitchen/listings/post updated). (2) Public profile now shows a back arrow on desktop too (was mobile-only). (3) Kitchen "Ordered" stat now derives from plate reservation (`max_plates − plates_left`) instead of summing the orders array, which was showing 0. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Directory privacy/vehicle + food merged into All Listings.** (1) Migration `0028` adds `show_in_directory` (opt-out toggle in profile; hidden residents excluded) + `vehicle_no` (shown in directory, collected at signup + profile). (2) **All Listings now includes Home Food + Tiffin as real filter categories** (not a separate card) — listings.tsx fetches dishes + tiffin plans alongside listings and unifies them into one table; "Home Food" and "Tiffin" filter chips added; food/tiffin rows route to `/food` (Order) with WhatsApp contact to the chef. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Resident Directory + tweaks.** (1) Order WhatsApp confirmation now only on **Accept** (not Cook/Delivered). (2) Society badge moved **above** the greeting on Home (desktop + mobile). (3) **Resident Directory** — migration `0027` adds `profiles.resident_type` (owner/tenant) + `profession`; new `/directory` screen (searchable, filter All/Owners/Tenants; Call/WhatsApp/Message per resident; desktop table + mobile cards). Collected at signup (optional) + editable in profile; shown on public profiles. NavRail "Residents" + Home tile. Signup/profile writes of the new fields are best-effort (`updateResidentInfo`) so they can't break account creation/editing if 0027 isn't run yet. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Order-flow + listings polish (from testing).** (1) Chef's Accept/Cook/Delivered now open a WhatsApp confirmation to the customer (`statusMessageForFoodie` via the action buttons). (2) Re-branded all user-facing WhatsApp/share copy "Senate Rasoi"/"Senate Chef" → **Aangan** (dish order, status, order chat, share, dev warning); audited messaging across food/tiffin/listing inquiries — all Aangan. (3) **All Listings** now surfaces **Home Food** as a card linking to `/food` (dishes are a separate engine, not in the listings table). (4) All Listings header now aligns with the table (shared `LIST_MAX` 1040, was a full-width header over a centered table) and category chips **wrap on desktop** so all are reachable (was a non-scrollable horizontal row); same chip fix applied to Search. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Post a dish/tiffin keeps the food tabs visible.** Posting previously navigated to the `/post` route, hiding the Discover/Orders/Kitchen/Tiffins bar. Made `PostScreen` reusable (optional `embedded`/`category`/`kind`/`onDone` props) and render it **inside** the food screen's Kitchen/Tiffins tabs (form sits below the persistent tab bar; "Back" + post both return to the list). KitchenSection/MyTiffinsSection post buttons now call an `onPost` callback (food.tsx toggles a `posting` state) instead of navigating. The standalone `/post` route (Post footer tab → picker) is unchanged. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Food IA refined.** (1) Empty-state "browse" buttons now switch the food tab (`onBrowse` callback) instead of routing to Home, so the Discover/Orders/Kitchen/Tiffins tab bar stays visible. (2) Orders "Browse today's menu" → Discover tab (was Home). (3) Separated one-off vs tiffin: removed the dish/tiffin toggle from the post form (type comes from the route); **Kitchen = one-off dishes only**; **Tiffins tab** now hosts tiffin-service posting + plan management (cook) *and* subscriptions (eater). (4) Discover empty state no longer has a "Post the first dish" button (points to Kitchen instead). tsc clean. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Food posting routes fixed + redundant FAB removed.** post.tsx mapped `category=food → null`, so every "Post a dish" button opened the category *picker* instead of the dish form — changed to `params.category ?? null` so `category=food` lands directly on the dish form (and `kind=tiffin` on the tiffin form). Updated all food post buttons (Discover empty, Kitchen empty, "New tiffin service") to pass `category:'food'`. Removed the redundant Kitchen "Post a dish" FAB; added an inline "Post a dish" button in `KitchenSection` for the non-empty case (mutually exclusive with the empty-state button). |
| 2026-06-09 | **Food UX reworked for the no-roles model.** Since anyone can now both cook and order, the Food screen (`/food`) got a segmented control — **Discover · Orders · Kitchen · Tiffins** — so a member can browse/order, track their placed orders (`OrdersSection`), manage their posted dishes + incoming orders (`KitchenSection`, with a "Post a dish" FAB), and see their tiffin subscriptions (`MyTiffinsSection`) all in one place. The **You** tab shed the now-duplicated food segments and keeps **My Listings · Saved** (default Listings). Works on desktop + mobile. tsc clean. |
| 2026-06-09 | **NavRail collapse alignment fix + society badge restyle.** Collapsed-rail icons (bell / New Post / avatar / nav) were pushed right because the centering offset ignored the section's `paddingHorizontal:10` — set `iconMarginL` collapsed shift `9 → 0` so they center properly. Society-name badge restyled to a prominent **violet** pill (filled icon + semibold colored text) on Home, You, and Profile. |
| 2026-06-09 | **All Listings → bottom tab (mobile).** Moved `listings.tsx` into the `(tabs)` group and added it as a persistent footer tab (Home · Feed · **Listings** · Post · Search · You), dropping the back button (it's top-level now). Removed the Home "All Listings" Community tile (replaced by the tab); NavRail "Listings" item unchanged for desktop. Block/delete (0025) + notifications (0026) **runtime-verified** against prod. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Notifications + listings polish.** Notifications now include the user's **own** actions (dropped the `actor_id != me` filter — verified own announcement appears). Modal gained per-row **read/unread toggle** + **Mark all read/unread** (added `markUnread`, verified read-row delete under RLS). **Bell** placed in persistent chrome: mobile → TopBar, right of the theme switcher; desktop → a "Notifications" row in the NavRail just above the New Post CTA (collapses to icon-only). (Earlier Home-greeting-row placement reverted.) **All Listings** redesigned from a card grid into a responsive **table** — desktop columns (Listing · Category · Price · View/Contact actions), compact rows + WhatsApp quick-contact on mobile. tsc clean. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Community-app rework: roles, admin moderation, all-listings, notifications, announcement banner.** (1) **Roles simplified** to member + admin — removed the chef/foodie picker at signup; every member can cook/post (ungated post.tsx/you.tsx); profile/admin show Member/Admin only. (2) **Admin member management** (migration `0025`): `profiles.blocked` + `admin_set_blocked`/`admin_delete_member` RPCs (own-community, self-protected). Admin page lists community members with Message (DM) / Make-admin / Block / Delete; sign-in refuses blocked members with a message (defensive if 0025 unrun), deleted → normal no-account path; auth context force-signs-out a member blocked mid-session. (3) **All Listings** screen (`/listings`) — cross-category FlashList feed + filter; NavRail item + Home tile. (4) **Notifications** (migration `0026`): `notifications` + `notification_reads` + triggers (post/announcement/listing/poll/DM) + realtime; `NotificationsProvider` + bell (NavRail + TopBar) with unread badge + modal (tap→read+route, mark-all-read). (5) **Announcement banner** on Home (latest announcement, dismissable, persisted). tsc clean. ⏸️ run migrations 0025 + 0026. |
| 2026-06-09 | **Nav chrome cleanup.** Desktop NavRail: replaced the loose bottom items (About row + theme toggle + tagline — cramped when collapsed) with a single **account row** (avatar + name) that opens a popover menu: Profile · About · Light/Dark · Sign out. New Post stays as the coral CTA. Mobile: removed the duplicate profile icon from the Home header (the "You" tab already covers it; `/profile/me` still reachable from You). |
| 2026-06-09 | **UX fixes + Messages directory.** (1) Replaced the bottom "Post"/"New Post" FABs with a compact round `+`: on category screens it sits in the header (right, category-coloured); on the feed it sits inline at the right of the filter-tabs row — cleaner alongside the desktop NavRail. (2) **Bug fix — Messages had no way to start a chat:** added a member-directory `messages/new.tsx` (searchable list of community neighbours → `getOrCreateThread` → thread), a `+` compose button in the inbox header, a "New message" button in the empty state, and `fetchCommunityMembers()` in `lib/dm.ts`; verified it returns real neighbours. (3) Brand logo/title in NavRail (desktop) + TopBar (mobile) now route to Home. tsc clean. |
| 2026-06-09 | **README rewritten** to match the current Aangan platform (was stale "Senate Chef" food-only/no-login docs). **Bug report investigated — NOT a bug:** "every feed post lands in General". Write path is correct (`createPost` inserts the selected `category`; single call site at feed.tsx) and a live DB read confirmed posts persist their real category (e.g. a `feedback` post stored as `feedback`, not `general`). The earlier test posts were simply created as General. No code change. |
| 2026-06-08 | **Polish: unread-DM badge + recent searches.** Migration 0024 run (listings RLS scoped). `UnreadDmsProvider` (one shared realtime sub) drives an unread-count badge on the NavRail "Messages" item + Home Messages tile. `lib/recentSearches.ts` (AsyncStorage, deduped, max 8) → tappable Recent chips in the Search empty state, saved on submit + result tap. Skipped Supabase Storage image transforms (paid Pro feature — would 400/break thumbnails on free tier). tsc clean. |
| 2026-06-08 | **DMs + FTS verified; listings RLS security fix.** Migrations 0022 (FTS) + 0023 (DMs) run and **runtime-verified against prod** (DM thread dedupe, realtime, participant-only RLS with non-participant blocked, inbox bump, mark-read; FTS stem-match on listings + posts). Added migration `0024_listings_read_scope.sql` tightening `listings_read` from `auth.role()='authenticated'` to community-scoped (matches posts/listing_messages) — closes a cross-society listings read leak. ⏸️ run 0024. |
| 2026-06-08 | **Phase 12b DMs + full-text search + PWA polish.** (1) Verified Phase 12a chat end-to-end against prod Supabase (insert/select RLS, persistence, realtime publication — PASS). (2) **DMs (12b):** migration `0023` (dm_threads/dm_messages + RLS + realtime + push + `dm_get_or_create_thread` RPC), `lib/dm.ts`, inbox + thread screens, Message button on profile, NavRail "Messages" + Home tile. (3) **Full-text search:** migration `0022` (search_tsv GIN on listings+posts), FTS-first `searchListings` + new `searchPosts`, Search screen Listings/Posts toggle. (4) **PWA:** Supabase preconnect/dns-prefetch in +html, sw.js precaches shell on install (cache→aangan-v2). Confirmed food photo resize already shipped. `tsc --noEmit` clean. ⏸️ run migrations 0022 + 0023. |
| 2026-06-08 | **NavRail collapse fix + tsc clean.** Collapsed left rail: "New Post" CTA and theme-toggle labels were missing `numberOfLines={1}`, so at `maxWidth:0` the hidden text wrapped vertically and ballooned the coral button height — added `numberOfLines={1}` to both (matches NavItemRow). Fixed the 2 remaining `tsc` errors: `router.push('/food' as any)` in index.tsx (Expo typed-routes) and `resolved` in theme.tsx now collapses `ColorSchemeName` (incl. `unspecified`/null) to `'light'\|'dark'`. `npx tsc --noEmit` now fully clean. |
| 2026-06-08 | **Phase 12a + polish shipped.** Per-listing chat: migration `0021_listing_messages.sql` (RLS, realtime, push trigger), `lib/listingMessages.ts`, collapsible `ListingChat` on listing detail. Polish: category + search grids → `FlashList` (numColumns, centered maxWidth; dropped `estimatedItemSize` for FlashList v2, incl. feed.tsx); `ListingCardSkeleton` for search; `IMAGE_CACHE_PROPS` (memory-disk + neutral blurhash + fade) on ListingCard/listing hero/DishCard; "N interested" inquiry-count badge on My Listings. Installed missing local dep `@shopify/flash-list`. ⏸️ user must run migration 0021. |
| 2026-06-08 | **Plan sync to reality:** backend live (all migrations 0001–0020 run, `listing-photos` bucket, community seeded, admin granted); web deployed to GitHub + Vercel. Corrected push token capture from "MISSING" to ✅ (wired in lib/push.ts, called from auth.tsx). Reconciled Phase 9 prose with dashboard (PostCard memo / posts FlashList / posts skeletons / posts pagination all ✅; listing-grid FlashList + search skeletons remain ⬜). Next code feature: Phase 12a per-listing chat. |
| 2026-06-08 | Plan major update: added E2E testing guide (Section 12), notifications analysis (Section 10), in-app chat analysis + Phase 12 plan (Section 11). Phase 9 items all complete: mobile nav to community features, posts pagination, announcement admin-only, PostCard memo, FlashList, skeletons, update banner. |
| 2026-06-08 | Phase 11 complete: Polls, Emergency Contacts, Saved Listings, Carpooling, Public Profile, NavRail updates, bookmark button on listing detail. Migrations 0018–0020 added. |
